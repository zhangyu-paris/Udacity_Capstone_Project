## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

#### Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/zhangyu-paris/Udacity_Capstone_Project.git

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is the Udacity Data Scientist Capstone Project. 

The Beijing housing market is highly important to the people and leaders of Beijing, and recently the housing price is increasing at a tremendous speed. 
With the housing price data of Beijing from 2011 to 2017, we will at first have a study with main focus on the following questions:

1. Which factors influence price the greatest?
2. The price increases at which speed?

Then we will try to build a model to forcast the housing price in Beijing, and compare the result with the real result with RMSE(Root mean squared error) as the metric to mesure our model.

With these studies may provide some advice to help people have a better understanding of the market in Beijing, and make decisions. And may also help the Chinese government to control the market more efficiently.



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Repository Data contains the house traded data in Beijing from the year 2011 to 2017, fetching from Lianjia.com.

There is also a notebook [A_Study_of_housing_price_in_Beijing.ipynb](https://github.com/zhangyu-paris/Udacity_Capstone_Project/blob/master/A_Study_of_housing_price_in_Beijing.ipynb) available here  to showcsae all my work related to the questions and model.




## Results<a name="results"></a>
